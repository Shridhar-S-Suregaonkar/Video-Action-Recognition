# 📽️ Video Action Recognition  

This project focuses on **human action recognition from aerial videos** using the *UAV-Human* dataset.  
The aim is to design a **deep learning pipeline** that can effectively learn **spatiotemporal features**  
and accurately **classify human activities** captured by drones.
